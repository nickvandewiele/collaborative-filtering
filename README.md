# Item-based Collaborative Filtering

Here, I explore item-based collaborative filtering (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering), a technique used in recommender systems.

I implement a recommender system for movies, based on the MovieLens 100K dataset (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).

The implementation of the item-based collaborative filtering procedure is done using Pandas. Nevertheless, I based my implementation on the excellent Udemy course "Taming Big Data with Apache Spark and Python - Hands On!" by Frank Kane (https://www.udemy.com/course/taming-big-data-with-apache-spark-hands-on/).
