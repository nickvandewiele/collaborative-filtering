    "# Item-based Collaborative Filtering using Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook I explore a technique to recommend items, called __item-based collaborative filtering__.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of the notebook is to create a system to recommend movies based on a movie that you have seen. The recommendations are made based on a dataset of movie ratings by people.\n",
    "\n",
    "I use the __MovieLens 100K Dataset__ (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). Copy the dataset from http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-100k.zip, and unzip it into a folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 files of the dataset are used:\n",
    "- `ml-100k/u.data` contains the 100k ratings.\n",
    "- `ml-100k/u.item` provides a mapping from a movie id to the name of the movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of the item-based collaborative filtering procedure is done using Pandas. Nevertheless, I based my implementation on the excellent Udemy course \"__Taming Big Data with Apache Spark and Python - Hands On!__\" by Frank Kane (https://www.udemy.com/course/taming-big-data-with-apache-spark-hands-on/)."

    "# Creating Pairs of Movie Ratings\n",
    "\n",
    "The first important idea of item-based collaborative filtering is to create pairs of movie ratings. If a person gives the same rating to two different movies, it means that this person likes the 2 movies more or less to the same degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, user X gives the following ratings of 3 movies:\n",
    "- user X, movie 1, 5 stars\n",
    "- user X, movie 2, 1 star\n",
    "- user X, movie 3, 5 stars\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, movie 1 and movie 3 both get 5 stars. Perhaps this person like science-fiction movies; movie 1 and movie 3 could both be science-fiction movies. That explains why the 2 movies received 5 stars by this user. On the other hand, perhaps this user hates westerns. Perhaps movie 2 was a western and therefore received a rating of only 1 star.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method that I use here to create pairs of movie ratings by the same user is the __self join__. The ratings table is merged onto itself, using the user id as the key to merge the 2 tables. The result of the self join is a new table, but with 5 columns instead of 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "`user id | movie 1 id | rating movie 1 | movie 2 id | rating 2`\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that only pairs of movie ratings are created for the same person. This is because we merge using the user id as the key.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The self-join operation can potentially lead to a table with a large number of rows. The number of created rows depends on the number of unique users in the ratings data. For example, if the table has N ratings of N different users, the self-join operation will not be able to create movie ratings pairs at all. "

If movies are rated very similarly across all the users, perhaps it means the movies are similar as well.\n",

    "\n",
    "We have a similarity and co-occurrence measure for every available pair of movies in our ratings data. We can use this data to recommend movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recipe for recommendation goes as follows:\n",
    "- Provide a movie that you have seen.\n",
    "- Look up all the movie pairs this movie appears in.\n",
    "- Sort the movie pairs of the seen movie based on the co-occurrence and similarity measures.\n",
    "- Return a list of top n of movie pairs with the highest co-occurrence / similarity measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we have 2 measures that we can use to recommend movies: co-occurrence and cosine similarity. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Why don't we just use cosine similarity?__\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, if the cosine similarity measure is based on a very low number of movie ratings, the similarity measure is probably not as trustworthy. So, we will only trust the similarity measure if there have been enough ratings for that movie pair. So we use the co-occurrence count as a minimum threshold. Only recommend a movie if it has appeared with a sufficiently large number of other movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other _edge cases_ of the recommender system:\n",
    "- each movie that we want recommendations for must appear in the original set of movie ratings. Since the MovieLens dataset is recorded in the late '90s, movies that have appeared after that date will not appear in the ratings data. So, the recommender system cannot make recommendations on those movies.\n",
    "- even if a movie appears in the original MovieLens dataset, there's no guarantee recommendations can be made for that movie. For example, if the movie has never been rated by a user that also rated other movies, no recommendation can be made. It is as if this movie is an outlier."
